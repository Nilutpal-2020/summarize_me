### Abstract

Summarization is a great way for making better use of the large quantity of material available to us on the Internet and in other archives.
An expert manual summary is a nearly hard and time-consuming task. To begin, the sentence vectors are created and the similarity matrix is
constructed using the TF-IDF vectorization. The original text is converted to a textual graph using TextRank, an extractive text
summarization-based method that takes into account sentence relevance, coverage, and diversity in order to evaluate each phrase using a
mix of statistical and semantic criteria. Then, to reduce the size of the original text, a sub-graph is generated.
The CNN/DailyMail dataset was utilized for evaluations, and the performance was measured with the ROUGE evaluation toolkit.
A topic specialist was also engaged for additional examination. Along with the summarised texts, sentiment analysis, i.e. whether the
summarised texts are good or negative, may be conducted. To determine the loglikelihood of a certain sentence, the sentiment analysis model
was trained using the Naive Bayes classification method. All of these models are then hosted as an Application Programming Interface (API),
and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was constructed as a web application where users may interact with the tools.
